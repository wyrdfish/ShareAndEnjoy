Useful things I have made that someone may want.

*MS/Bootstrapper/DotNetFX48*
This is a working copy of the Microsoft bootstrapper manifest for .net 4.8 redist. the one supplied in SDKs is buggy. This can also be used for clickonce.

*MessageBoxManager/MessageBoxManager.cs*
This is a version of the winforms messageBOx customization class that works with dotnet (i tried it with 8).
